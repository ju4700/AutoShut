# 🛑 Torrent Auto Shutdown - Project Complete! 🛑

## ✅ What's Been Created

Your Python desktop application is ready! Here's what you now have:

### 📁 Main Files:
- **`dist/TorrentAutoShutdown.exe`** - Your main executable (ready to use!)
- **`run_app.bat`** - Easy launcher with instructions
- **`torrent_shutdown.py`** - Source code
- **`README.md`** - Detailed documentation

### 🚀 How to Use Right Now:

1. **Double-click `run_app.bat`** or go to the `dist` folder and run `TorrentAutoShutdown.exe`

2. **Set up your download folder**: Click "Browse" and select where qBittorrent downloads files

3. **Start monitoring**: Click "Start Monitoring" button

4. **Let it run**: The app will monitor qBittorrent and your download folder

5. **Go to sleep**: When downloads complete, it will show a countdown and shutdown your PC

### 🔧 How It Works:

The app monitors:
- ✅ qBittorrent process network activity
- ✅ CPU usage of qBittorrent
- ✅ File modifications in your download folder
- ✅ Multiple checks to avoid false positives

### 🛡️ Safety Features:

- **Test Mode**: "Test Shutdown" button to verify without actually shutting down
- **Countdown Timer**: 60-second countdown with cancel option
- **Multiple Checks**: Requires sustained inactivity before triggering
- **Minimum Time**: Waits at least 2 minutes before considering download complete

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **Make sure qBittorrent is running** when you start monitoring
2. **Test first** using the "Test Shutdown" button
3. **Run as administrator** if shutdown doesn't work
4. **The app will actually shutdown your PC** - this is not a simulation!

### 📋 File Sizes:
- Executable: ~15-20MB (includes all dependencies)
- Portable: No installation required, just run the .exe

Your torrent auto-shutdown tool is ready! Sweet dreams! 😴
